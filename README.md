2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[The first challenge that I ran into was when I tried to add more buttons to the project. 
The buttons displayed beautifully, but there was no sound when I pressed on them. I examined every single line of javascript code and realized that since I added buttons,
the number of elements in the pattern array should also be increased to a number bigger than the number of buttons that I now had as a few functions relied on that variable in order to produce sounds.
After I was able to get the sound back again, I tried to add images to the buttons, so when the user clicks it, an image will be displayed. 
The optional prework section recommended changing the CSS rules, so I tried to add CSS rules to specify when the images should be shown or hidden by specifying that the display should be 
changed from hidden to inline when the button is "active". However, the images did not show up when the button was clicked. 
Instead, I tried implementing a javascript function that would show and hide the images, my first few attempts were unsuccessful as the images did not show up when the button was pressed. 
I tried using DOM manipulation too but to no avail. Finally, I saw a piece on w3schools about how to implement it, so I followed along, and to my surprise, it worked! 
I had spent a few hours trying to get the images to show up so I was very pleased. On top of that, I tried adding other images, so the background would look more interesting, 
I went onto the Bootstrap website where there were some examples on how to position images on a website. It took a bit of experimenting to get the pictures to a satisfactory position. 
For instance, I kept having to change the "top" and "start" numbers that were in the class.
Lastly, I tried changing the background color to complement the images that I had just added, but for some reason, the color did not change. I solved this problem by
specifying the background color in the html instead of the css file.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[From this experience, I have found styling to be the trickiest part of web development. For instance, how do we position images where we want them or 
how do you override default values that are already set? Why do some elements not show up even after we already specified the style in the CSS file?
How do we change elements of a website more effectively? Most of my experience has to do with the front-end side of web development, I'd also like to learn more about backend and how both front-end and back-end connect with each other.
I also want to learn how to build a website that scales when the number of users increase. Also, I know that databases store our information
and that there is SQL and no SQl databases. What's the difference between the two?]



4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would change the sound of the buttons to get them to play longer tunes that 
will form a song. I would also try to improve the part where when the user presses the button, an image will be shown. Right now, the 
button will move when pressed because of the image, and it takes two clicks to hide the image again, so with more time, I would have
try to get the picture to hide itself, as soon as the user is no longer clicking on it, and the button to stay in the same position
when clicked. Lastly, I would also try to position the images in the background better.]
